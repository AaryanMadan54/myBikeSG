# myBikeSG

## Note (darryl)
### DO NOT DO `npm install react` I broke my version doing that ðŸ’€
App is inside `/mybikesg`, change directory to `/mybikesg` then run `npm start` to start the app in your local host

Get Google Maps API key following https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key , then create a `.env.local` file locally **OUTSIDE OF `/src`** and enter

`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "{YOUR_API_KEY}" (without the curly braces)`

I think you need to set up a billing account because I don't think it's free to use google maps API XD but they give $300 as a 'sign up bonus' which should be enough to last till presentation week
